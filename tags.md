These are the tags I use for email subjects.

Tag format:
- beginning of subject line
- lowercase
- [enclosed in brackets]
- single space between tag and subject
- tags can be stacked, with a a single space between them. consider filters accordingly. (You may see **[doc] [action]** for example)

Ex:  
Subject: **[foo] Bar the baz**  
Subject: **[urgent] [action] Check out this dank meme**

I'd like to shorten some of these, but I realize not everyone is willing or able to read the glossary, so I prefer they be self-explanatory as possible.

**[time-sensitive]** There is a deadline related to this.  
**[urgent]** There is a deadline, and that deadline is right now.  
**[action]** I'd like you to do something.  
**[response]** A response is requested (if you work FOR me, it's probably required).  
**[doc]** There is a doc attached. (Or there is supposed to be. I have probably forgotten to attach it.)  
**[notes]** Notes, typically from a meeting we just had.  
**[fyi]** Just letting you know. It's probably worthwhile info, but not urgent.  
**[nonwork]** Something neat that is not work related and you can feel free to bin this without missing anything.
